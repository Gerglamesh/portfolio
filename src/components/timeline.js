                        I recently completed my second internship at Plejd,

                        smart lighting solutions. At plejd I've worked on 
                        project aimed at migrating an existing REST API 
                        into one based on GraphQL.

                        During my first internship at Plejd I was working 
                        on creating a frontend in React with Redux for an
                        application called OpenAOI. OpenAOI is, as of now,
                        proprietary code for automating occular inspection
                        in industrial processes. In time the project is 
                        supposed to go open source.

                      <p>
                        In 2019 I started on my path to become a professional
                        software developer. The program is dompleted on the
                        28th of may 2021. During the course of my studies I 
                        have come into contact with many frameworks and languages
                        such as .Net (Core, Framework, ASP etc.), Entity Framework, 
                        React, C#, JavaScript, T-SQL, HTML, CSS etc. I have also 
                        studied cloud solutions through Azure, microservices and
                        Docker as well as setting up CI and CD pipelines through 
                        both Azure DevOps and GitHub. For a more complete list

                      <p>
                        After getting my degree in social work and social studies
                        I was hired by the social services in VÃ¤stra Hisingen, 
                        Gothenburg, at the section for addiction and substance abuse.
                        I was responsible for managing contacts with my clients and
                        investigating applications for aid and assistance with 
                        anything from solving housing problems to managing and getting
                        rid of substance abuse. I was also responsible for coercive 
                        legislations in severe cases. <br/>
                        <br/>
                        I later transferred to the section for social housing
                        since Gothenburg was, and still is, in a housing crisis.
                        There I worked with trying to stop evictions and finding
                        people at risk of eviction in time and trying to help 
                        them. I also managed different types of housing first 
                        solutions.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        In 2018 I was hired by Fastighetskontoret (real estate 
                        and property management for Gothenburg City) in Gothenburg.
                        Here I am now on leave during my studies in software 
                        development. At Fastighetskontoret I still work with 
                        housing first solutions. The difference is I am now not
                        only a social worker but a landlord as well. The unique
                        situation of both trying to manage the myriad of 
                        connections with other landlords and real estate owners
                        and connections to social offices and tenants themselves
                        puts me in a situation where I am constantly improving 
                        my skills in communication, organization and ability 
                        to see the whole picture.

                      <p>
                        During my studies I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity
                        of doing an internship abroad. I travelled to Kampala, Uganda, 
                        to work at an NGO (Non Governmental Organisation) called the
                        Fortress. The Fortress is a home for pregnant teenage women 
                        who have been cast out of their families due to their pregnancy.
                        Often they had been taken advantage of in some way. Our mission 
                        was to try and help them either get back to their families, 
                        resettle them somewhere else or helping them find a sustainable
                        way of life. With help from donations we even managed to get a 
                        few them to a boarding school where they could live and study.
                        We also helped them with their pregnancies, paying for their 
                        hospital bills when they where due to deliver. It was varying,
                        tough and rewarding work which taught me many valuable skills
                        and lessons about life and my profession.

                        In 2011 I started taking my degree in social work.
                        Both studying and practicing social work has taught 
                        me many useful skills in active listening, critical thinking,
                        empathy, communication and cooperation to name a few.
                        It has also taught me how to identify and piece 
                        together information to be able to get a clearer and
                        broader view of any problem I encounter. My bachelors thesis
                        was a quantitative survey investigating the prevalence of
                        online bullying in young teenagers.
