                    <strong>Hi I'm Hampus Kjellstrand </strong>
                    and I love the challenge of developing applications that
                    have a real impact on peoples lives. My developer philosophy
                    is centered around the idea that great code is great, but an
                    application that can make lives easier for others is even
                    better! 
                  </p>

                    <strong>A winding path.</strong><br/>
                    My road towards working professionally with code has been a
                    winding one. Even though I've always had a passion for, and
                    interest in technology, I also had other interests I was
                    pursuing. As I've always been an empathic person and a good
                    listener, I started out with a career in social work.
                    During my studies I had the opportunity to travel to Uganda
                    for an internship at an NGO, helping to resettle cast out
                    and pregnant young women. This taught me many valuable
                    skills in cooperation with different organisations and the
                    communities around Ugandas capitol Kampala. It also
                    bolstered my abilities in lifting my perspective towards the
                    bigger picture and the opportunities that comes with an
                    overview of different situations. It also taught me humility
                    for the task at hand, for the persons I worked with 
                    and the women I worked for.

                    <strong>Career in social work.</strong><br/>
                    After getting my social workers degree (socionomexamen) I've
                    worked with at the social services VÃ¤stra Hisingen and at 
                    fastighetskontoret (real estate and property management for Gothenburg City) 
                    in Gothenburg. At the social services I've had a wide range 
                    of responsibilities stretching from assesing applications
                    for both addict, housing and economic support as well as 
                    dealing with coercive legislation in severe cases. <br/>
                    At fastighetskontoret I have mainly been involved in 
                    managing and assesing cases for social housing. The policy 
                    we work by is based in the collection principles, theories
                    and ideas stemming from the housing first approach. <br/>

                    <strong>A coder comes along.</strong><br/>
                    My interest in coding has not gone amiss in my employments.
                    Since I've always had a knack for, and interest in, making
                    small applications for the betterment of my workplaces
                    workflows I was often tasked with producing code for 
                    automating and producing spread sheets and other types of 
                    statistics to be used both for tracking performance at 
                    the workplace and the creation of quarterly and annual 
                    reports. One of my bosses explicitly told me that I'd taken
                    weeks of labour off from producing these reports. This 
                    corresponds very well with how I think technology could be
                    best utilised. Identifying areas of improvement, establishing
                    a overview of what problems needs to be solved, and then 
                    automating work that only takes time away from tasks better 
                    suited for humans. Doing this not only saves time and money,
                    it also lets people focus on what they're good at, increasing 
                    performance and work satisfaction all over.

                    <strong>New Beginnings.</strong><br/>
                    The more I worked with code and applications, both at work
                    and at home, I started thinking that maybe I should make one of
                    my passions my career. After all, the most satisfying work
                    I did had something to do with coding. After speaking to my
                    best coder friend during one of our hobby projects, I decided to 
                    start working towards a career in software development. I 
                    enrolled in a fullstack development program centred around 
                    the .Net-framework and now, two years later, I look back on
                    many fun days of working with lots of different and fun frameworks,
                    languages and, not the least, people. I am now ready to take 
                    the step into the wild world of software development and 
                    make my impact on the task of bettering the lives for people
                    and companies out there with my coding skills.

                    <strong>In conclusion...</strong><br/>
                    I'm an easy going and positive fella' who likes playing
                    music and travelling as much as I like developing
                    applications. Although I usually don't take many pictures
                    from my travels I've picked out two of my favourite ones for this
                    web page.
